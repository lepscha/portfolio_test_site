            After years spent building a successful career in finance, Jacob
            Hensley still felt that something was missing. Looking towards a
            career change, his thoughts were constantly drawn to his lifelong
            passion for and wealth of experience with animals. His time in the
            demanding world of finance gave Jacob a deep understanding of how
            important it is for busy owners to know their pets are getting the
            best possible care, attention, and exercise. Drawing on his
            experience walking, breeding, and training dogs, Jacob set out to
            create a pet care company that would blend reliable and professional
            service with a personal touch. He founded District Dogs in 2014.
